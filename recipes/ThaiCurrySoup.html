 <li>  2 teaspoons red curry paste</li>
            
<li>   1 (32 ounce) carton chicken broth</li>
            
<li> 2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            
<li> 1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            
 <li>  1 (13.5 ounce) can reduced-fat coconut milk</li>
            
<li> 1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves</li>
            
<li>  ½ cup peeled and deveined medium shrimp</li>
            
 <li> ½ cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            
<li>  ¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>
<li> 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            
<li> 2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
     </ul>

<h2 style= color:orange><b>Steps</b></h2>
 <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rice noodles and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 3 minutes. Drain and rinse well with cold water to stop the cooking; set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic, lemongrass, and ginger; cook and stir until aromatic, 30 to 60 seconds. Add curry paste and cook for 30 seconds. Pour in about 1/2 cup chicken broth and stir until curry paste has dissolved, then add soy sauce, sugar, and remaining chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover partially and simmer for 20 minutes.

    </li>
    <li> Stir in coconut milk, spinach, shrimp, mushrooms, cilantro, and lime juice. Increase the heat to medium-high 
        and simmer until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 5 minutes.

    </li>
<li>To serve, place some rice noodles into each serving bowl and ladle soup over the top. Garnish each bowl with a sprinkling of sliced green onion.</li>
